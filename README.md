# Features
Different Levels of Difficulty: Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, each with different grid sizes and mine counts.
Error Handling: Enhanced error handling to prevent crashes and ensure a smoother gameplay experience.
Improved Interface: A more user-friendly interface

# Files
main.py: Initializes and runs the game with difficulty selection.
cell_config.py: Defines the behavior and interactions of each cell in the game.

# How to Play
Run the game.
Select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) by clicking on the respective buttons.
The grid will be generated based on the selected difficulty.
Left-click to reveal a cell. If it's a mine, you lose. If it's not, it will show the number of surrounding mines.
Right-click to flag or unflag a potential mine.
The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed or a mine is clicked.
